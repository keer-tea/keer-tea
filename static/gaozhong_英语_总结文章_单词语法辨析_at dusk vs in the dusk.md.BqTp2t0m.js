His face was barely visible at dusk. = Every day, at dusk, his face could barely be seen.</p><h3 id="reply-2" tabindex="-1">reply 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#reply-2" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;reply 2&quot;">​</a></h3><p>No, &#39;at dusk&#39; is the time: the time when the outside world becomes twilight as the sun is setting. You can be inside a brightly-lit room at dusk. But you won&#39;t be in the dusk, that is outside in the half-light of sunset.</p><p>ask:</p><p>Do I need the in this sentence?</p><p>Little by little, (the) dusk was falling.</p><p>reply:</p><p>You don&#39;t need the to make the sentence grammatical; as a stand-alone sentence it&#39;s fine with or without the.

It is dusk, and his face is barely visible because of the low light.</p><p>&#39;His face was barely visible at dusk&#39; means that every time it is dusk, his face is barely visible. Now this may well be true if he is outside (logically it makes sense), but it&#39;s not quite the same meaning.</p><p>Edit: Cross-posted twice, oops!</p>',22)]))}const k=t(r,[["render",l]]);export{c as __pageData,k as default};
